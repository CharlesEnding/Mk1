Architecture:
  A scene:
    has models.
    has shader programs.
  A material:
    has parameters.
    has textures.
  A model:
    has meshes.
    has materials.
    has transforms.
    has meshes to material.
  A mesh:
    has vertices.
    has a material.
    has a texture.

An eye rolling around the character's base on the ground indicates the way he's looking
We can call out to players to get their attention
